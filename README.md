# Map-Coloring-Problem-using-Constraint-Satisfaction-Algorithm

Variables: WA, NT, Q, NSW, V, SA, T 

Domains: Di = {red, green, blue} 

Constraints: adjacent regions must have different colours

This is the map of Australia and we have 7 regions. The constraints are that the neighbouroing countries shouldn't have same color using only red, blue and green color. For doing this we have first defined the CSP algorithm in which we have defined the variables, Domains and constraints. Using Backtrack search algorithm we are satidfying the constraints. And then we have defined our map coloring problem and defined variables, domains and the constraints for this problem. Then we are also looking for consistency and all.
